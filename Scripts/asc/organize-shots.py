"""Rename a folder of raw screenshots to the canonical set, by CAPTURE ORDER —
so you shoot in the listed order, dump the files in one folder, and this names
them without you having to look at each image.

The order is the SCREENSHOTS.md shot list. The set is the same on iPhone and
iPad; pass the platform for the filename suffix.

  # print the order to shoot in (do this first):
  Scripts/asc/organize-shots.py iphone --list

  # after dumping raw shots into <dir> (sorted by filename = capture order):
  Scripts/asc/organize-shots.py iphone <dir>
  Scripts/asc/organize-shots.py ipad   <dir>

Sorted by filename ascending — Simulator names captures by timestamp, so
lexical sort == capture order. Pass --by-mtime if your names don't sort
chronologically.

Multiple languages in ONE folder: shoot each language's full set back-to-back,
dump all into <dir>, and pass the order with --langs. The files split into
per-language subfolders, canonically named:

  Scripts/asc/organize-shots.py iphone <dir> --langs en
  # → <dir>/en/rally-iphone.png, …

Expects exactly (shots × languages) files; the first chunk is the first
language, and so on.
